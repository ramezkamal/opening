🎛️ Neon, creative, and interactive — this README is designed to stand out.  
I build real‑time computer vision systems, optimize models for edge devices (Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson), and ship production‑ready AI solutions that solve real problems.

> "Turn pixels into insight. Turn models into impact."

Thanks — tell me which 3 repos to feature if you want different ones, and paste any GIF/screenshot URLs.  

When you're ready:
- Reply with: Upload confirmation and target repo/branch (example: "Upload to ramezkamal/ramezkamal branch main, overwrite yes")  
- If you want me to use a different repo (e.g., one of your existing repos), provide that repo name and branch.

I will wait for your "Upload" instruction before pushing the README to your repository.
